## Kitty

> [!BUG]
> This seems to also get rid of the icons expanding when there is
> available space...

- [ ] Replace `CaskaydiaCove NF` for plain `CascadiaCode` and use kitty's
  Unicode points options for displaying all kinds of special symbols.
  This will solve the issue with some ligatures (like `<<=` and `|-`). Keep
  the Nerd Font variant since is use in other programs (`waybar`).
